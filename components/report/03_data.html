            On loading the data we can can see that we can see that for the Mathematics course we have 395 rows and 33 columns
            and for the Portuguese language course we have 649 rows and 33 columns

            <br><br>Additional note on the data: there are several (382) students that belong to both datasets .
            These students can be identified by searching for identical attributes
            that characterize each student, as shown in the annexed R file.
