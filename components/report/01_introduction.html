    Introduction
    <div class="report-section">
        <p>
            Education is the core that determines a countries success.
            The data we will being analyzing is from a Portugal school system.
            There are two data sets one for the math class and the other for the Portugal language class.
            We will attempt to explore the data and find any interesting patterns in the two data sets.
            We will also use machine learning techniques to create predictive models that can predict a students grade performance based on the various features.

            <br><br>
            In the data sets we have real world features such as demographics, social, school related, grade related features for students from a Portugal school system.
            We also have their grade performance for period 1, period 2, and final grade.
            In this analysis we will focus on the final grade and classify them as pass or fail.
            Then we will use this data set to train various machine learning classification models and try to come up with the best performing classification model.

            <br><br>
            The goal is to build a Predictive Model to be able to accurately predict students who will pass a specific class given a set of features.
            The assumption of a passing grade is assumed to be any score > 10.
            We will also explore both the data sets and see if we can find any interesting findings.
