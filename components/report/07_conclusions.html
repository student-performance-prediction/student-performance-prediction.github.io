            <b>Predictive Model Summary</b>
            <br>
            The goal was to build a Predictive Model to be able to accurately predict students who will pass a specific class given a set of features.
            The assumption of a passing grade was assumed as any score > 10.
            The model was to have a high accuracy in claas 0, class 1, and over all accuracy.
            In order to achieve this we came up with three different models specific for each classes accuracy.


            After building multiple classification models and tuning them for the best performance,
            the best performing model were Logistic Regression with weighted class weights or Random Forest.
            Logistic regression performed extremely well in class 0 and class 1 accuracies.
            Logistic regression also performed well in both the Math class data set and the Portuguese language class data set.
            Random Forest performed better than Logistic regression on the over accuracy on the Portuguese language class data set.

            <b>Data Exploration Summary</b>
            <br>
            Some interesting findings from the data were:
            <ul>
        <li>Fathers eduction and mothers education of the child were highly correlated.
            This could be because in Portugal couples marry withing their education level or class in the society</li>
        <li>
            The number of past class failures caused the grades to drop. The high negative correlation showed this.
        </li>

        <li>
            Fathers eduction and mothers education level had a positive correlation to child's grade.
            This could be because the the well educated parents could be helping the child at home.
            Thus scoring better grades
        </li>

        <li>
            Fathers eduction and mothers education level had a negative correlation with failures.
            This comes back the last point where the educated parents are helping the kid at home to get better grades and hence less failures
        </li>

        <li>
            Workday alcohol consumption and weekend alcohol consumption are positively correlated showing that
             kids who drink in the work day also drink on weekend
        </li>

        <li>
            Going out and consuming alcohol are positively correlated showing that kids get alcohol mostly from going out
        </li>

    </ul>
