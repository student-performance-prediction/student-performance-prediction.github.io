            There are several analysis already done on this data set. The first one "USING DATA MINING TO PREDICT
            SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT PERFORMANCE" was the main reference for this project.
            This can be found  <a href="http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

            In this project the prediction approach used was to find models that perform a high classification accuracy on each individual class of the label.
            In this was if we wanted to predict students who pass with a higher accuracy over students who fail we have a one model specific for that.
            And if we wanted to predict students that fails with a higher accuracy over students who pass we have another model for that.
